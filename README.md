# WebDev Bootcamp

Hello, this is my repository of the excercises and projects created while completing my online Web Development Bootcamp.

If you would like to know how this was all done, or want to learn how to do it for yourself, I invite you to enroll in the course as well, it is a Udemy online course created by Colt Steele, which you can find [here](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

Exercises directory is for small basic exercises, projects is for bigger and complete webpages, either just front or full stack.
